## AnyChart Bonfire
This sample is created to show you the power of [GraphicsJS Library](http://www.graphicsjs.org/) which is a free part of AnyChart JavaScript Charts Library and can be used to vizualize virtually anthing. In this case it is a bonfire. A few lines of code and, due to the flexibility of our framework, you see an animated flame on your page: it may seem like a joke, but this goes anywhere: you can use AnyChart to create infographics, customize the smallest parts of your charts or create your own chart types.
